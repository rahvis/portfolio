<p>I decided to write this book because when I began filing patents, I noticed a gap in available literature. Existing books either focused solely on the legal aspects of patenting or provided guidelines on generating ideas and innovations. What was missing was a practical example demonstrating how to design an innovative solution for specific problem statements within risk-sensitive domains, particularly in enterprise data storage. Despite the existence of only four books on Conformal Prediction as listed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_prediction#Books" target="_blank">Wikipedia (Conformal prediction)</a>, I recognized the need for a fifth book that would approach the topic from an <b>inventor's perspective</b>, rather than from an academic theory or industrial applications.</p>
