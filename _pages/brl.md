 <h2>Common Resolve: Tackling Ghost Job Listings</h2>

    <p>
        In current job market, workers face a significant challenge: ghost job listings. 
        A 2024 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/08/13/36-of-job-adverts-are-fake-how-to-spot-them-in-2024/" target="_blank">Forbes survey</a> 
        revealed that <strong>36% of all job postings online are fake</strong>, meaning job seekers waste 
        <strong>one-third of their time</strong> applying to positions that don’t exist. This not only frustrates 
        workers but also undermines the efficiency of the entire job market.

    </p>

    <p>
        At <strong>Common Resolve</strong>, we developed a <strong>Chrome Extension</strong> to combat this issue 
        by identifying the likelihood of a job listing being a "ghost." Our tool leverages data-driven insights to help 
        job seekers focus their efforts on genuine opportunities, saving them time and energy.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze patterns in job listings to detect fake or misleading posts.</li>
        <li>Provide workers with clear, actionable information about the legitimacy of a job posting.</li>
        <li>Continuously refine the tool to adapt to evolving trends in job fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Since its launch, the <strong>Common Resolve Extension</strong> has empowered workers to make smarter job 
        search decisions by avoiding ghost jobs. This tool is helping workers reclaim their time, ensuring their efforts 
        are directed toward real opportunities that value their skills.
