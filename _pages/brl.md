    <p>
        In current job market, workers face a significant challenge: ghost job listings. 
        A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/08/13/36-of-job-adverts-are-fake-how-to-spot-them-in-2024/" target="_blank">Forbes survey</a> 
        revealed that <strong>36% of all job postings online are fake</strong>, meaning job seekers waste 
        <strong>one-third of their time</strong> applying to positions that don’t exist. This not only frustrates 
        workers but also undermines the efficiency of the entire job market.
