## Common Resolve: Tackling Ghost Job Listings  

### The Problem  
In current job market, workers face a significant challenge: ghost job listings. A 2024 [Forbes survey](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/08/13/36-of-job-adverts-are-fake-how-to-spot-them-in-2024/) revealed that **36% of all job postings online are fake**, meaning job seekers waste **one-third of their time** applying to positions that don’t exist. This not only frustrates workers but also undermines the efficiency of the entire job market.  

### The Solution  
At **Common Resolve**, we developed a **Chrome Extension** to combat this issue by identifying the likelihood of a job listing being a "ghost." Our tool leverages data-driven insights to help job seekers focus their efforts on genuine opportunities, saving them time and energy.  

- **Approach**:  
  - Analyze patterns in job listings to detect fake or misleading posts.  
  - Provide workers with clear, actionable information about the legitimacy of a job posting.  
  - Continuously refine the tool to adapt to evolving trends in job fraud.  

### Impact  
Since its launch, the **Common Resolve Extension** has empowered workers to make smarter job search decisions by avoiding ghost jobs. This tool is helping workers reclaim their time, ensuring their efforts are directed toward real opportunities that value their skills.  

- **Get the Extension**: [Download on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/common-resolve/hemkacfkmhldlhpfndjfibkalfphiibf).  

### The Team Behind It
